I started off Part 4 of this assignment going over Part 3 and deciding what needed to be changed. Once I had a better visual and understanding of what I wanted the final version to look like, I began making the NASA APOD API work in my code. Once I got the API to work and photos were appearing, I needed to add the functionality of a 'favourites' button so that a collection of favourites would show up under the image of the day, as well as be able to delete each favourite individually. This was a challenging part and I succeeded with the help of a tutor through the college. Finally having a functional website where everything remains on the page when refreshed, I began to style it which is my favourite part. I drifted away from my original mockup from Part 2 but I kept the same dark theme with sharp edged buttons and a blue secondary colour. I ended up liking this version much better as it is very clean and simple which I think is perfect for this type of site. This took a lot of time and effort and overall, I am quite happy with how it turned out.
